Academy_cinema is a project where I learn using bootstrap in designing and creating a webpage for cinema. Almost all elements that were used in this project were from bootstrap website.
```
```
One-Page Website
In this project I have learnt how to create my own footer and to add some links on the page, use iframe, and add nav bar on page.
```

Pizza_Project
This project contains a sample of a pizza menu 
```

TicTacToe
This is a very fun project where I was able to add my own choice of images to be used for the game creation and also added sounds.
```
```
RevisePortfolio
This is my only live project which can be seen in the internet. I used godaddy to make the project live.
This contains a JavaScript and all basic html and css elements.
